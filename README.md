## About MeðŸš€

I'm currently doing my bachelors in B.tech Computer Science, not sure if I'm gonna complete it.

From wanting to become a 3D Animator to becoming a Full-Stack Blockchain Developer I have experienced so many things which I personally think were very important.

The whole Defi, Metaverse, NFTs, Dapps, and web3 caught my interest.

My programmer journey was so unexpected, from AI&ML I came across web3&blockchain, and from then I haven't looked at anything else.

Working hard on building a web3 community(Blotic) to educate other and show them what Blockchain/web3 can really do!
